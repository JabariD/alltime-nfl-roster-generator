Perfect — let’s break this monster into **bite-sized milestones** so you’re not stuck in “analysis paralysis.” Think of these as **checkpoints** that you can realistically hit in order, each one delivering something tangible you can look at.

# 🏈 Milestones for All-Time Madden Legends Roster

## **Milestone 1: Environment & Repo Skeleton**

✅ Outcome: You have a working repo with folders, env, and tests stubbed.

* Install VS Code + Python 3.11 + `uv` (or poetry).
* Clone/init repo with the structure we outlined.
* Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (ruff, black, mypy, nbstripout).
* Add empty `models.py`, `adapters/madden_26.yaml`, and `scripts/build_players_index.py`.
* Run `pytest` → passes with just placeholder tests.
  👉 Now you’ve got scaffolding.

---

## **Milestone 2: Player Index (the pool)**

✅ Outcome: You have `data/raw/players_index.csv` with all NFL players and IDs.

* Implement `scripts/build_players_index.py` to crawl `/players/A/` → `/players/Z/`.
* Save CSV with: `player_id, full_name, first_year, last_year, pos, teams`.
* Sanity check: \~27k rows, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Jerry Rice all present.
  👉 Now you can browse the pool.

---

## **Milestone 3: Candidate Filtering**

✅ Outcome: A trimmed list (\~8–10k players) of “eligible legends.”

* Write `pipeline/normalize.py`: clean names, harmonize positions, bucket eras.
* Filter out <32 games, or no peak (based on AV or honors).
* Output `snapshots/<DATE>/players.parquet`.
  👉 Now you’ve got a clean candidate roster.

---

## **Milestone 4: Peak & Career Scoring**

✅ Outcome: Each candidate has a `PeakScore`, `CareerScore`, `RankScore`.

* Implement `pipeline/peaks.py` to find top-3 consecutive seasons.
* Implement `pipeline/rank.py` → composite scores with weights (from `config/weights.yaml`).
* Write to `snapshots/<DATE>/ranked_players.parquet`.
  👉 Now you can rank players per position.

---

## **Milestone 5: Roster Selection (\~3,500 players)**

✅ Outcome: A balanced roster pool with quotas per position.

* Add quotas (config-driven).
* Select top-X per position to hit \~3,500.
* Save selection manifest (who got cut in/out).
  👉 Now you can list the “All-Time Legends Pool.”

---

## **Milestone 6: Attribute Mapping (Rules-Only)**

✅ Outcome: First pass Madden-style ratings (rules only).

* Implement mappers in `pipeline/ratings/` for 1–2 positions (say QB + WR).
* Use era percentiles → 40–99 mapping.
* Output `ratings.parquet`.
* Sanity check with histograms (no crazy 99s, distributions look good).
  👉 Now you can open Jerry Rice and see his 96 SPD, 99 CTH, etc.

---

## **Milestone 7: Archetypes & Modifiers**

✅ Outcome: Style-based diversity in ratings.

* Cluster WRs (e.g., deep threat vs possession).
* Apply ±3 nudges in attributes.
* Store archetype label in `players.parquet`.
  👉 Now rosters feel “alive” instead of cookie-cutter.

---

## **Milestone 8: Adapter & Export (Madden 26 CSV)**

✅ Outcome: Game-ready CSV.

* Implement `pipeline/export.py` with `adapters/madden_26.yaml`.
* Translate FRCS → Madden 26 fields.
* Save to `data/exports/madden26/<DATE>/roster.csv`.
  👉 Now you can drop into a roster tool.

---

## **Milestone 9: Validation & Audits**

✅ Outcome: Confidence your numbers make sense.

* Add pytest unit tests for mapping.
* Add outlier detector (flagging weird cases).
* Add era fairness check.
  👉 Now you trust the outputs.

---

## **Milestone 10: AI/ML Enhancements (Optional Upgrade Path)**

✅ Outcome: Smarter, less hand-tuned ratings.

* Train LightGBM/CatBoost on recent Madden ratings (QB accuracy, OL blocking, DB coverage).
* Add imputation models for missing combine data.
* Integrate LLM to label archetypes and explain mappings.
  👉 Now the system blends rules + ML seamlessly.

---

# 🎯 Suggested Roadmap (time-based)

* **Week 1:** Milestones 1–2 → repo + player index CSV.
* **Week 2:** Milestones 3–4 → candidate filtering + rank scores.
* **Week 3:** Milestones 5–6 → 3,500-player pool + first rule-based ratings.
* **Week 4:** Milestones 7–8 → archetypes + Madden 26 export.
* **Beyond:** Milestones 9–10 → validation + AI upgrades.

👉 Question for you: do you want me to **draft the code for Milestone 2 (build the player index script)** so you can immediately grab the master pool of \~27k players from PFR? That’s the key unlock before you can do anything else.

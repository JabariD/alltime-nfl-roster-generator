Perfect — let’s break this monster into **bite-sized milestones** so you’re not stuck in “analysis paralysis.” Think of these as **checkpoints** that you can realistically hit in order, each one delivering something tangible you can look at.

# 🏈 Milestones for All-Time Madden Legends Roster

## **Milestone 1: Environment & Repo Skeleton**

✅ Outcome: You have a working repo with folders, env, and tests stubbed.

* Install VS Code + Python 3.11 + `uv` (or poetry).
* Clone/init repo with the structure we outlined.
* Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (ruff, black, mypy, nbstripout).
* Add empty `models.py`, `adapters/madden_26.yaml`, and `scripts/build_players_index.py`.
* Run `pytest` → passes with just placeholder tests.
  👉 Now you’ve got scaffolding.

---

## **Milestone 2: Player Index (the pool)**

✅ Outcome: You have `data/raw/players_index.csv` with all NFL players and IDs.

* Implement `scripts/build_players_index.py` to load nflverse datasets via nflreadr.
* Combine `load_players()`, `load_rosters()`, `load_draft_picks()`, and `load_combine()`.
* Save CSV with: `player_id, full_name, first_year, last_year, primary_pos, teams, draft_info`.
* Sanity check: \~27k+ rows, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Jerry Rice all present.
* Data spans 2002+ with comprehensive biographical and positional data.
  👉 Now you can browse the pool.

---

## **Milestone 3: Position-Specific Legend Scoring**

✅ Outcome: Each player has a `legend_score` for each position they played.

* Implement `pipeline/legend_scores.py` to calculate position-specific legend scores.
* For each player-position combination, analyze: physical attributes (height, weight, speed), draft position, career stats, honors, and position-specific factors.
* Weight factors differently per position (e.g., height matters more for OL than WR, speed crucial for DB/WR).
* Output `snapshots/<DATE>/legend_scores.parquet` with columns: `player_id, position, legend_score`.
  👉 Now you can identify the best players at each position across all eras.

---

## **Milestone 4: Roster Selection (\~3,500 players)**

✅ Outcome: A balanced roster pool with quotas per position.

* Add quotas (config-driven).
* Select top-X per position to hit \~3,500.
* Save selection manifest (who got cut in/out).
  👉 Now you can list the “All-Time Legends Pool.”

---

## **Milestone 5: Attribute Mapping (Rules-Only)**

✅ Outcome: First pass Madden-style ratings (rules only).

* Implement mappers in `pipeline/ratings/` for 1–2 positions (say QB + WR).
* Use era percentiles → 40–99 mapping.
* Output `ratings.parquet`.
* Sanity check with histograms (no crazy 99s, distributions look good).
  👉 Now you can open Jerry Rice and see his 96 SPD, 99 CTH, etc.

---

## **Milestone 6: Archetypes & Modifiers**

✅ Outcome: Style-based diversity in ratings.

* Cluster WRs (e.g., deep threat vs possession).
* Apply ±3 nudges in attributes.
* Store archetype label in `players.parquet`.
  👉 Now rosters feel “alive” instead of cookie-cutter.

---

## **Milestone 7: Adapter & Export (Madden 26 CSV)**

✅ Outcome: Game-ready CSV.

* Implement `pipeline/export.py` with `adapters/madden_26.yaml`.
* Translate FRCS → Madden 26 fields.
* Save to `data/exports/madden26/<DATE>/roster.csv`.
  👉 Now you can drop into a roster tool.

---

## **Milestone 8: Validation & Audits**

✅ Outcome: Confidence your numbers make sense.

* Add pytest unit tests for mapping.
* Add outlier detector (flagging weird cases).
* Add era fairness check.
  👉 Now you trust the outputs.

---

## **Milestone 9: AI/ML Enhancements (Optional Upgrade Path)**

✅ Outcome: Smarter, less hand-tuned ratings.

* Train LightGBM/CatBoost on recent Madden ratings (QB accuracy, OL blocking, DB coverage).
* Add imputation models for missing combine data.
* Integrate LLM to label archetypes and explain mappings.
  👉 Now the system blends rules + ML seamlessly.

---

# 🎯 Suggested Roadmap (time-based)

* **Week 1:** Milestones 1–2 → repo + player index CSV.
* **Week 2:** Milestone 3 → position-specific legend scoring.
* **Week 3:** Milestones 4–5 → 3,500-player pool + first rule-based ratings.
* **Week 4:** Milestones 6–7 → archetypes + Madden 26 export.
* **Beyond:** Milestones 8–9 → validation + AI upgrades.

👉 Question for you: do you want me to **draft the code for Milestone 2 (build the player index script)** so you can immediately grab the master pool of \~27k+ players from nflverse-data? That's the key unlock before you can do anything else.

**Note:** Using nflverse-data instead of PFR scraping respects data usage policies while providing comprehensive, regularly-updated NFL datasets including player biographical info, rosters, combine data, and draft history.
